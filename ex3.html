      <span style="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)[9], often abbreviated as JS,
      is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] <span style="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> is high-level,
      often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
      Alongside HTML and CSS, <span style="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
      [11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.
      [13] Most web browsers have a dedicated <span style="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on the user's device.
      As a multi-paradigm language, <span style="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional,
      and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
      regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
